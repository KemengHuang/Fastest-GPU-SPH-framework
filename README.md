# Fastest-SPH-framework
This framework represents the fastest implementation of an extended GPU SPH method utilizing the uniform grid approach.

DESCRIPTION
===========
This project is the source code of ["Novel Hierarchical Strategies for SPH-centric Algorithms on GPGPU"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gmod.2020.101088)
and ["A General Novel Parallel Framework for SPH-centric Algorithms"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3321360). 

This project offers the fastest optimization strategy utilizing the Uniform grid. When compared to a well-optimized GPU SPH method based on the uniform grid, the method proposed in the papers demonstrates a significant speed improvement of up to 3.5 times. As a result, it serves as an excellent benchmark for conducting further research on GPU SPH and facilitates meaningful comparisons.
